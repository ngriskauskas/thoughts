Speak thou of Hat thine great one!
Prescribe oneself to Will, and thus may it be that thine essence flows forth


As souls we are trapped, as apes we are gods. Heighten your dualism, draw your soul back into spirit and the world will be yours. Let being be as it is to be, for mind is found in forgoing its contents. Inhere in the world as the world inheres in you, and you will know the Father. Give your being to Mother, for she is the womb through which soul is constituted.
