Hierarchy of Abstraction

Knowledge divides phenomenological reality into a fractal hierarchy of abstract ideas (meant merely psychologically, not necessarily metaphysically, though the difference is debatable).  One can represent simplified versions of this hierarchy with a tree-like structure, ex. cell -> branch  -> tree -> forest -> ecosystem -> planet -> solar system -> universe.   

Principle of Sustainability

Because phenomenological reality takes on temporality as a means of representing change (or as a psychologically necessary result of change, and thus Being), conscious existence is characterized by the underlying substance (matter) subject to fluctuations (in time). These states (atemporal material configurations) must   

Coherence Ethics




That which maintains unity with the above abstracted or "emergent" qualities maintains itself at the level of those abstract or "emergent" qualities. This truism is useful for understanding continuity or "temporality" as the foundation of ethical action. Ethics exists as applicable with respect to specific contexts in time, and thus is defined within boundaries of abstraction. For example, there may be an ethics of trade between villages. These ethics are the demand for sustainability of trade - which could be seen as the upper layer abstraction served by its components of lower layers - i.e.. the individual exchanges of trade, road conditions, whatever else relevant to what is deemed "trade".  If the upper layer "trade as a whole" abstraction is optimally served (or worshipped so to speak), trade will be maintained between villages. However, were individual "lower level" components to "rebel" or "fall from grace", as in to stop serving the upper  abstraction, the upper abstraction would be tenuously maintained and eventually cease to be.  So if tradesmen were to violate the ethics of the "upper" abstraction by robbing caravans,  counterfeiting, or manipulating the market (just anything that in a strictly utilitarian way reduces the likelihood of trade longevity), they are betraying the "god of trade" and it will punish them.  

Therefore in accordance with the hierarchic structure of abstract temporal constructs ethics is constituted. These god forms (upper abstractions) are subject to selective pressure, and thus through temporal refinement 
Temporal refinement is to be considered in time modifications of the abstraction to serve further upper abstractions, thus constituting the entire domain of ethics as a temporal construction to serve the sustaining principle (temporally elaborated selective pressure). Ethics is thus the sustaining principle's expression, and a particular Ethics is an attempt to conceive the sustaining principle with respect to one's locality in temporality. 

From this can be seen the unifying (upwards movement) force as each layer of abstracting serving its parent abstraction
