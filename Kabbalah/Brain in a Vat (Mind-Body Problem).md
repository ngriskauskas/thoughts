Given the structure of creation phenomenologically determined by the [[Tree of Life]], we have an adequate language and structure to address the age old brain in a vat / simulation argument.  The question stems from the false (unsynthesized) dualism of Mind and Body. The problem's "residue" is left over after its synthesis in the form of elaborated imaginative form of future scenario, which further serves to solidify our psychological constitution (weltanschauung) as active philosophy. 

Psychologically, the concept shares its motive with that of reincarnation, or whatever other form of "life-rejection" one can construct, as an attempt to carry the ego construct out of its existential dilemma. The moment one recognizes conscious existence inherently to its object-form valuation process through divine marriage of [[Subject-Object]], one is able to embrace those object phenomenon characteristic of consciousness as the prima causa of the conscious essence itself.  It thus that to properly conceive the brain in a vat question is to drop out the locality of presence of the environmental object-domain (including the physical body, sub-conscious, unconscious, etc.). Were the mind were to wake up from its vatful dream state, the subject-object relational constitution is so altered as to have no participation in the object-domain of the previous existence, at least insofar as it is deprived of its past-referencing structure. Therefore, as memory (or past-referencing) is itself contained in the object-domain produced by physical locality (subconscious) it cannot be said that characterization or personalization of this higher conscious mind can have anything to do with the localizing quality of the incarnate mind. What's left is only the illuminating force itself, pure subject-consciousness [[Kether]], which has been determined in [[Subject-Object]] as only asymptotically approachable, #subject-in-itself belonging to the pre-formic domain of the supernal. These "life-rejecting" speculations all reduce to what is known as "wishful thinking", masking as genuine metaphysical insight, ego masquerading as self, the accessibility of #subject-in-itself ignored with the pretense of hyperconsciousness.
