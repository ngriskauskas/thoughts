Phenomenologically, being can be said to be at very least a self-sustaining something-or-other. As if the primordial truth, you'll never lose a debate about whether something or nothing exists. Simply the cognition that nothing exists is blatantly self refuting. 

Within this firmly established something can be delineated the necessary process for its phenomenological coherence. As referred to in [[Epistemic - Knowing]] the delineating process itself must, if used (it is by virtue of cognition it is used, as to be demonstrated), be itself contained in the domain of this something. 

Thus one speaks of the primordial, supernal dualism from which this being (noun) comes into being (verb). As the noun being must for itself have constitution as a something, referential awareness necessitates the antinomy of oneness as a simultaneous temporal being. At this level to act is to be, to think is to create. It is thus written as God in two forms, as to act / be (verb) is to collide logically with that plane of unacted acts. To be in time posits foundational difference or splitting apart of the supernal domain. These two forms are the great creator and destroyer, father and mother,  one which drives itself into the other. The Subject and Object of phenomenology.  Neither can be said to precede the other as they simultaneously logically require each other. The masculine principle is said to drive through the feminine, the phallus and the womb of God. As with the Subject and Object (as symbols of the same universal referent), the nature of each half requires its other half to have meaning.  

By virtue of the primordial dualism and its logical coherence only as syzygy, oneness as a relational constitution is birthed, i.e. the Son.  The synthesis of the supernal (absolute) dualism is necessitated which is mythologized as offspring of the masculine and feminine principles.   

Phenomenologically this three fold division is representative of our complete contact with the absolute. [[Subject-Object]] demonstrates the phenomenological account that births conscious experience.
