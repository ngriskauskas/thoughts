O praise we sing to thee, to call forth our highest souls, to cast ourselves into ourselves. 
That he oh Thoth speak for me, that he oh Thoth sing his song through my tongue, that I speak this magical rite and be heard my ringing sung.
We rise here our alter high, with praise to forces known through time:
Oh Eastern bright, fly round us, Raphael swiftly rinse our Minds, ground us, in those winds we take flight - boundless. 
Western sign, called forth as pillar devine, wash us with your waters, cleanse us, take us to our Fathers. 
Hail ye Southern fire, burn us brightly, take us up, incinerate our hearts, for we are your pyre.
Abound us oh horrors of the North, we pay our wages to thee forth, that your terrors be acknowledged, that your underworld rein in darkness. 
Oh great one highest, the light of our being belongs to thee, where death implicates itself, for in therein we find our glee. Thus we sing our song, and cast our souls to whom they belong: that great father he, that one that takes all that we be, this hymn we speak forth, that our pain, misery and horror be taken, that our souls themselves are cast into that pit - that we are no longer  subject to it. To him, the dweller, we cry out: take us, take us, to be as we belong. For laying out our souls to be consumed, we free ourselves, rebirthed in Mother's great womb. For she hears our cries, she points us to our lies, she strikes us down from false profound, she casts her stench were mortals themselves quench.
