1. Preparations
	1. Participants are to sit in symmetrical arrangement about central alter / incense structure
	2. 
2. Rules / Expectations for Ritual Conduct
	1. In accordance with the contents of the ritual purpose: invocation of entity (god-form, archetype), shared astral experience, gratitude, etc.
		1. The purpose is to be single mindedly pursued, thus unrelated thoughts are to be withheld entirely
	2. Disruptions are to be reserved for absolute emergencies only
	3. When the ritual is in progress withhold all reflective commentary, treat the ritual to the degree as one would in hunting / pursuing prey and that absolute silence and concentration on the target is required to succeed, where communication is needed it should be well considered before hand and thus as an automatic process during ritual proceedings (consider again the style of communication in the hunting analogy, think maybe of how communication works in team sports: brief, minimally necessary, and sufficiently efficient to avoid distraction from the game itself)
		1. One would not suddenly blurt out "I forgot my antelope spear, wait lemme run and go get it real quick", when in close pursuit of antelope together with others that are maintaining absolute focus on the subtle movements of the antelope
	4. The sanctity of ritual pursuit should be maintained at all costs, changes to ritual structure are thoughts to be discarded until after completion, just as meta analysis is seen as yet another distraction during meditation
3. Opening
	1. Before beginning the proceedings it is necessary to create sanctity in the ritual space
		1. Thus in accordance with the focus of the ritual appropriate symbols should be used to saturate the senses
			1. Music, incense, an alter, sigils, whatever else
		2. Participants should be centered, fully awake (not too tired, etc.) and briefly
