As mythological god forms the archetypal forces are said to be those essences which have their being in the unconscious domain that characterizes our psychological existence.

How is one to concretize the god forms as to relate them to actuality, thus to "name" or conquer these forces? At some level the attempt is to understand the forces as occurring in the objective material world, or at least rooted in the physical, which acts as the vessel into which higher emanations pour - cultural conceptions, abstract ideas. Thus an analysis involves bare consideration of pervading psychological determinates pervading in society. As the only accessible reflection of these archetypes available to the individual are that which is contained in the individual (ontologically, as the coinciding of object and subject), one would presumably due well to acquire an honesty about his analysis being a mere inner reflection of the supposed totality. "Objective" analysis with regards to "upper level" abstractions like the archetypes (serving as those higher life forces), is only possible insofar as it remains subjective, as complete and coherent disclosure of one's own psychology.
